## Welcome here
 ðŸŒŸ**Frontend Projects Showcase**

Welcome to my **Frontend Projects** repository! This collection includes a variety of web-based projects built using modern technologies and deployed live using **GitHub Pages** â€” explore them through the links below:

* **Purpose & Highlights**
  Each project showcases my ability to design and develop responsive, accessible, and interactive web applications. I am tracking real-world challenges like API integration, state management, and animations.

* **Tech Stack**
  Primarily built with **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript (ES6+)** â€” many projects also utilize **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and the **Fetch API** for dynamic data handling ([isabelcosta.github.io][1], [github.com][2]).

* **Live Demos & Source Code**
  All projects are **live on GitHub Pages**, with direct links below for both demos and source code. No local setup required â€” just click and explore!
